## Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. Expected API Rate Limiting
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Expected Behavior

```
Error fetching low cap gems: Error: CoinGecko API error: 429 Too Many Requests
```
**Impact:** Minimal - System retries automatically with exponential backoff
**Action:** None required - this is normal with free CoinGecko API tier

### 2. Legacy Duplicate Positions
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Historical Data

Some tokens have multiple positions in the database from before duplicate prevention was implemented:
- PEPE: 10 positions across portfolios
- MEW: 12 positions across portfolios
- This is not causing any issues with current display or trading logic

**Impact:** None - Frontend correctly handles multiple positions with unique IDs
**Action:** None required - duplicate prevention now active for new trades

### 3. OAuth Callback
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Under Investigation

Enhanced logging has been added for Google OAuth debugging. User testing required to diagnose redirect completion issue.

---

## Recent Bug Fixes Verified

### âœ… Duplicate React Key Warning (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Positions using `tokenId` as React key caused warnings when same token had multiple positions
**Fix:** Updated to use unique `position.id` field instead
**Verification:** 
- TypeScript types updated with `id` field
- Frontend using `position.id` as key
- Browser console clean - no warnings
- All positions render correctly

### âœ… Real-Time Updates (WORKING)
**Status:** Dashboard, Portfolio, and Trade Journal all receive WebSocket updates
**Verification:**
- WebSocket connections established
- Portfolio updates broadcasting
- No connection errors

---

## Data Consistency Verification

### Cross-System Validation
âœ… **Tokens Tracked:** 117 (Database â†” Scanner API â†” ML Analyzer)
âœ… **Portfolio Value:** $37,454.19 (Consistent across updates)
âœ… **Active Positions:** 72 (Auto-trader â†” Position Tracker)
âœ… **System Status:** LIVE (All services running)

### Position Uniqueness
âœ… **207 positions with 207 unique IDs** - No ID conflicts
âœ… **Each position properly identified** - No React key warnings
âœ… **Duplicate prevention active** - Logs confirm: "Position already exists, skipping duplicate buy"
